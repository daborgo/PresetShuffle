# PresetShuffle

Ever suffered from the (very real and not placebo) syndrome in which your car preset dictates how good you are at Rocket League?

If so, you might want to install __Preset Shuffle__! This plugin shuffles between your presets stored in your garage after a specific amount of games determined by the user, so you can automate your car changes and improve your gameplay (definitely data-proven)!

## Features:

* Enable Plugin checkbox to toggle on/off the game-shuffle cycle.
* Lock Preset checkbox to keep your current preset and temporarily disable automatic game-shuffle cycle.
* Shuffle Preset button to instantly shuffle between your presets in your garage.
* Number of Games slider to determine how many games should pass between shuffling.
